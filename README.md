# VehicleImagesClassification
Classification of images of vehicles

The goal of this project is to classify images of vehicles. Two main approaches are used: 
1) We use a pretrained neural network to extract the most important features of the images, before feeding these features to different classifier ( i.e.: k-nn classifier, random forest, logistic regression, dense neural network)
2) We use the raw data in a convolutional neural network built from scratch 

The predictive performance of all approaches are compared to one another as well as to a base model for bemchmarking. 

The project is split in 9 jupyter notebook, each covering a different approach.
